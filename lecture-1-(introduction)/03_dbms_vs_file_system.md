Here's a more detailed comparison:

| **Aspect**      | **File System**                                         | **DBMS**                                               |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Searching**   | - Searching is slow as it requires scanning files sequentially.<br> - No efficient indexing mechanism. | - Faster searching due to **indexing, hashing**, and **query optimization** techniques.<br> - SQL queries make data retrieval easier and faster. |
| **Attribute**   | - Limited to basic file properties (name, size, date).<br> - No concept of **data types** or constraints. | - Supports **rich attributes** like data types, constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE), and relationships.<br> - Ensures data integrity. |
| **Concurrency** | - Weak concurrency control.<br> - Multiple users accessing the same file may lead to **data corruption** or inconsistency. | - Strong concurrency management using **locking** and **transactions**.<br> - Ensures data consistency with **ACID** properties. |
| **Security**    | - Basic security with file-level permissions.<br> - No fine-grained access control. | - Advanced security with **user authentication, authorization**, and role-based access control.<br> - Supports encryption and auditing. |

✅ **Key Difference:**  
- **File systems** are basic storage mechanisms, while **DBMS** offers advanced features like structured data management, fast retrieval, and better security, making it more suitable for handling large and complex data.

Here's a comparison of **File System vs DBMS** using an **IRCTC (Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation)** example:

| **Aspect**      | **File System (Without DBMS)**                                  | **DBMS (With Database)**                               |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Searching**   | - Passenger details are stored in multiple files (e.g., CSV, TXT).<br> - To search for a passenger, the system scans each file one by one, which is **slow**. | - Passenger data is stored in **relational tables** (e.g., `Passengers`, `Tickets`, `Trains`).<br> - Searching is **faster** using **SQL queries** (e.g., `SELECT * FROM Passengers WHERE PNR = '1234567890';`). |
| **Attribute**   | - Each file contains limited attributes (PNR, name, age, etc.).<br> - Adding new attributes (e.g., contact number) requires **modifying all files**. | - In DBMS, tables have **rich attributes** with defined data types.<br> - Adding new attributes is **easy** (just add a column). |
| **Concurrency** | - When multiple users book tickets at the same time, the system may create **conflicting entries** or **duplicate records**. | - DBMS handles **concurrent transactions** smoothly.<br> - Uses **locking mechanisms** to prevent double booking. |
| **Security**    | - Security is limited to file-level permissions.<br> - A hacker with access to the file can see **all passenger data**. | - DBMS offers **role-based access control**.<br> - Only authorized users (e.g., admins) can access sensitive passenger data.<br> - Data can be encrypted. |

✅ **Example in action:**  
- **File System:** If IRCTC uses a file system, booking a ticket may take longer due to slow searching, and concurrent booking could cause inconsistencies.  
- **DBMS:** With DBMS, the system can **quickly search for trains, book tickets, and prevent double booking**, ensuring data consistency and security.

Here's how **redundancy** differs between **File System** and **DBMS** using the **IRCTC example**:

| **Aspect**         | **File System (Without DBMS)**                                  | **DBMS (With Database)**                                |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Redundancy**     | - **High redundancy** due to **duplicate data**.<br> - Example: Passenger details (name, age, contact) are stored **repeatedly** in multiple files for every booking.<br> - This wastes **storage** and causes **data inconsistency**. | - **Low redundancy** due to **normalization**.<br> - Passenger details are stored **once** in a `Passengers` table.<br> - Multiple bookings refer to the same passenger ID, avoiding duplication. |

✅ **Example in action:**  
- **File System:**  
   - Suppose **Rahul** books 3 tickets for different trains. His details (name, age, contact) are stored **3 times** in different files.  
   - If he updates his contact number, it needs to be changed in **all files** separately, which can lead to **inconsistency** if one file is missed.  
- **DBMS:**  
   - Rahul's details are stored **once** in the `Passengers` table with a **Passenger ID**.  
   - All bookings refer to this **single entry**, reducing redundancy.  
   - Updating his contact number automatically reflects in **all bookings**, ensuring **data consistency**.  

✔️ **DBMS reduces redundancy through** **normalization**, which organizes data into related tables, preventing duplication and improving efficiency.
