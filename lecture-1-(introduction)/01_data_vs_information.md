When people say **"data is the new oil,"** they mean:

- Just like oil was the most valuable resource in the industrial age,  
- **Data** is the most valuable resource in the digital age.
- **But** â€” like crude oil, raw data by itself is **not very useful**.  
- It needs to be **processed, refined, and analyzed** to create **valuable products** (like information, knowledge, insights).

**Real-world example:**

ðŸ”¹ Suppose you run an online clothing store.

- You collect **data** like:
  - What products customers click on
  - How long they stay on a page
  - What they put in the cart but donâ€™t buy
  - Their age, gender, and location

ðŸ‘‰ **This is raw data** â€” just like unprocessed crude oil.

ðŸ”¹ Now you **analyze** it and find out:
- "Most people from New York aged 20â€“25 are adding sneakers to their cart but not buying them because of high delivery charges."

ðŸ‘‰ **This is information** â€” valuable, actionable knowledge.

ðŸ”¹ Using this **information**, you can:
- Offer free delivery on sneakers in New York
- Boost your sales

**Summary:**  
- **Data = Crude oil** (raw and useless until refined)  
- **Information = Petrol, Diesel, Plastic** (useful products after refining)
