Letâ€™s break down everything shown in your image (sections 6, 7, and 8 of ER Model) into very simple, clear explanations with examples. These topics are:

1. **Relationships**
2. **Relationship Constraints**
3. **ER Notations**

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Relationships in ER Model

### 1. **What is a Relationship?**

A **relationship** in an ER Model shows how two or more **entities** are **connected** or **related** to each other.

#### ðŸ“Œ Example:

* A **student** "takes" a **course**
* A **customer** "borrows" a **loan**
* A **person** "has" a **vehicle**

### 2. **Strong Relationship**

A relationship between **two independent (strong) entities**.

âœ… Example:

* **Student** takes **Course**
* Both Student and Course are independent and exist on their own.

### 3. **Weak Relationship**

A relationship involving a **weak entity** that depends on a **strong entity**.

âœ… Example:

* **Loan** and its **Payment**
* A payment doesnâ€™t make sense without a loan. So, `Payment` is weak and `Loan` is strong.

## ðŸ”¹ 6.1 Degree of Relationship (Number of Entities Involved)

| Type    | Meaning                             | Example                           |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Unary   | One entity related to itself        | Employee manages another employee |
| Binary  | Two entities involved (most common) | Student takes Course              |
| Ternary | Three entities involved             | Employee works-on job in a branch |

## ðŸ”¹ 7. Relationship Constraints

### 1. Mapping Cardinality (also called Cardinality Ratio)

This tells how many instances of one entity are associated with how many of the other.

### ðŸ”¸ (i) One to One (1:1)

Each entity in A is related to **at most one** entity in B, and vice versa.

âœ… Example:

* **Citizen** â€“ has â€“ **Aadhar Card**
* One citizen has one Aadhaar card.

### ðŸ”¸ (ii) One to Many (1\:N)

Each entity in A relates to **many** entities in B, but each entity in B relates to **only one** in A.

âœ… Example:

* **Citizen** â€“ has â€“ **Vehicles**
* One citizen may have multiple vehicles, but each vehicle belongs to only one citizen.

### ðŸ”¸ (iii) Many to One (N:1)

Each entity in A relates to **only one** entity in B, but one entity in B may relate to **many** in A.

âœ… Example:

* **Many Courses** â€“ taught by â€“ **one Professor**

### ðŸ”¸ (iv) Many to Many (M\:N)

Each entity in A can relate to **many** entities in B, and vice versa.

âœ… Example:

* **Customers** â€“ buy â€“ **Products**
* **Students** â€“ attend â€“ **Courses**

### 2. Participation Constraints (Minimum Cardinality)

Tells whether all or only some entities are required to participate in the relationship.

### ðŸ”¸ Partial Participation

Not all entities in the set need to participate.

âœ… Example:

* **Customers** may or may not **borrow a loan**.

### ðŸ”¸ Total Participation

**All entities** must participate in the relationship at least once.

âœ… Example:

* **Loan** â€“ must be connected to a **Customer** (canâ€™t exist alone)
* So, **Loan** has total participation in the relationship with Customer.

ðŸ“Œ **Note:**

* Weak entities always need **Total Participation** with their strong entity.
* Strong entities may or may not have total participation.

## ðŸ”¹ 8. ER Notations

ER Notations are **symbols** used to draw the ER Diagram. Examples include:

| Symbol           | Meaning                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Rectangle        | Entity                    |
| Diamond          | Relationship              |
| Oval             | Attribute                 |
| Double Oval      | Multivalued Attribute     |
| Underlined       | Key attribute (unique ID) |
| Double Rectangle | Weak Entity               |
| Double Diamond   | Weak Relationship         |

### âœ… Summary Table

| Concept                   | Simple Example                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Unary Relationship**    | Employee supervises employee         |
| **Binary Relationship**   | Student takes Course                 |
| **Ternary Relationship**  | Employee works-on Job in Branch      |
| **One-to-One**            | Citizen has Aadhaar card             |
| **One-to-Many**           | Citizen owns many vehicles           |
| **Many-to-One**           | Many students assigned to one hostel |
| **Many-to-Many**          | Student attends many courses         |
| **Total Participation**   | Loan must belong to a customer       |
| **Partial Participation** | Some students have scholarships      |
