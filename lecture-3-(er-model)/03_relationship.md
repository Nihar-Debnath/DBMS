## 🔹 6. Relationships in ER Model

### 1. **What is a Relationship?**

A **relationship** in an ER Model shows how two or more **entities** are **connected** or **related** to each other.

#### 📌 Example:

* A **student** "takes" a **course**
* A **customer** "borrows" a **loan**
* A **person** "has" a **vehicle**

### 2. **Strong Relationship**

A relationship between **two independent (strong) entities**.

✅ Example:

* **Student** takes **Course**
* Both Student and Course are independent and exist on their own.

### 3. **Weak Relationship**

A relationship involving a **weak entity** that depends on a **strong entity**.

✅ Example:

* **Loan** and its **Payment**
* A payment doesn’t make sense without a loan. So, `Payment` is weak and `Loan` is strong.

## 🔹 6.1 Degree of Relationship (Number of Entities Involved)

| Type    | Meaning                             | Example                           |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Unary   | One entity related to itself        | Employee manages another employee |
| Binary  | Two entities involved (most common) | Student takes Course              |
| Ternary | Three entities involved             | Employee works-on job in a branch |

## 🔹 7. Relationship Constraints

### 1. Mapping Cardinality (also called Cardinality Ratio)

This tells how many instances of one entity are associated with how many of the other.

### 🔸 (i) One to One (1:1)

Each entity in A is related to **at most one** entity in B, and vice versa.

✅ Example:

* **Citizen** – has – **Aadhar Card**
* One citizen has one Aadhaar card.

### 🔸 (ii) One to Many (1\:N)

Each entity in A relates to **many** entities in B, but each entity in B relates to **only one** in A.

✅ Example:

* **Citizen** – has – **Vehicles**
* One citizen may have multiple vehicles, but each vehicle belongs to only one citizen.

### 🔸 (iii) Many to One (N:1)

Each entity in A relates to **only one** entity in B, but one entity in B may relate to **many** in A.

✅ Example:

* **Many Courses** – taught by – **one Professor**

### 🔸 (iv) Many to Many (M\:N)

Each entity in A can relate to **many** entities in B, and vice versa.

✅ Example:

* **Customers** – buy – **Products**
* **Students** – attend – **Courses**

### 2. Participation Constraints (Minimum Cardinality)

Tells whether all or only some entities are required to participate in the relationship.

### 🔸 Partial Participation

Not all entities in the set need to participate.

✅ Example:

* **Customers** may or may not **borrow a loan**.

## 🔸 **Total Participation** (explained like you’re 10)

### 💡 Imagine a Relationship in Real Life:

Think of a **relationship** in a database like a connection between two things.

Let’s say:

* **Customer** takes a **Loan**
* This is a relationship: `TakesLoan(Customer, Loan)`

Now, the question is:

> **Can a loan exist in the system if no one has taken it?**

The answer is **NO** — a **Loan** must be connected to a **Customer**.
It **can’t be alone** like a ghost loan floating around.

That’s called **Total Participation**.

## ✅ Total Participation: In Simple Words

> **All items (entities) in one table must be connected to something in another table.**

If an entity has **total participation** in a relationship, that means:

* **Every single record** in that entity **must** take part in the relationship.

### 🔁 Example:

| Customer\_ID | Name  |
| ------------ | ----- |
| 101          | Alice |
| 102          | Bob   |

| Loan\_ID | Amount | Customer\_ID |
| -------- | ------ | ------------ |
| L001     | 5000   | 101          |
| L002     | 10000  | 102          |

Here:

* Every **Loan** must be linked to a **Customer** → ✅ **Total Participation of Loan**
* But a **Customer** may not have taken any loan → ❌ **Not total participation for Customer**

### 📌 Weak Entities Always Have Total Participation

* A **weak entity** means it **cannot exist without another entity.**
* Example: **Dependent** of an employee (like a child or spouse listed in employee benefits)

So:

* **Dependent** (weak) always needs an **Employee** (strong)
* That means **Dependent** has **total participation** in the relationship with Employee

## 📷 Picture This:

```
Customer ----------- Loan
            |
         takes
```

If **every loan** MUST be linked to a customer → **Loan has Total Participation**

If **some customers** have no loans → **Customer does NOT have Total Participation**

## 🚩 Summary

| Concept                 | Meaning                                                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total Participation** | Every entity **must be linked** in the relationship            |
| **Loan → Customer**     | Loan needs Customer → Total Participation of Loan              |
| **Weak Entities**       | Always have total participation with the entity they depend on |
| **Strong Entities**     | May or may not have total participation                        |

## 🔁 Let’s Revisit the Example with YOU in It:

You are a **Customer** in a bank.

* You have a **bank account**
* But you **do not have a loan**

So in this case:

* You exist in the **Customer** table ✅
* But you are **not connected** to any **Loan** ❌

### ✅ What This Proves:

* The **Customer** entity **does not have Total Participation** in the `TakesLoan` relationship.

  * Because **some customers (like you)** don’t have a loan.

But let’s think about the **Loan** side:

* Can a **Loan** exist in the system **without** a Customer?

  * No! Every Loan must be linked to someone who took it.

✅ So the **Loan** entity **does have Total Participation** in the relationship with Customer.

## 🧠 Simple Rule to Remember:

| Entity   | Must be in Relationship?      | Total Participation? |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Customer | ❌ Not always                  | ❌ No                 |
| Loan     | ✅ Always linked to a customer | ✅ Yes                |

## 🔔 In summary:

* **You, as a customer without a loan**, prove that **Customer → Loan** is **not total participation**.
* But if a **Loan is made**, it always needs a **Customer**, so **Loan → Customer** is **total participation**.


## 🔹 8. ER Notations

ER Notations are **symbols** used to draw the ER Diagram. Examples include:

| Symbol           | Meaning                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Rectangle        | Entity                    |
| Diamond          | Relationship              |
| Oval             | Attribute                 |
| Double Oval      | Multivalued Attribute     |
| Oval Underlined  | Primary Key attribute     | 
| Double Rectangle | Weak Entity               |
| Double Diamond   | Weak Relationship         |
