1. **What ER diagram symbol represents**
2. **When to use ER diagram symbol**
3. **A simple real-life example**

### ✅ **1. Entity**

* **Shape:** Rectangle
* **Use When:** You have a real-world object or concept that has data stored about it.
* **Example:**

  * `Student`, `Customer`, `Book`, `Loan`, `Employee`

> Entities become **tables** in the database.
> Each entity has attributes (fields) like name, ID, etc.

### ✅ **2. Weak Entity**

* **Shape:** Double Rectangle
* **Use When:** The entity **cannot exist without another (strong) entity**. It has **no complete key of its own**.
* **Example:**

  * `Payment` for a `Loan`
  * `Dependent` of an `Employee`
  * `Order_Item` under `Order`

> Needs help from a **strong entity’s key** to be uniquely identified.

### ✅ **3. Attribute**

* **Shape:** Oval
* **Use When:** You define **properties or characteristics** of an entity or relationship.
* **Example:**

  * For `Student`: Name, Roll Number, Age, Address
  * For `Book`: Title, ISBN, Author

### ✅ **4. Multi-valued Attribute**

* **Shape:** Double Oval
* **Use When:** An entity can have **more than one value** for this attribute.
* **Example:**

  * `Phone_Number` of a person (can have mobile, home, office)
  * `Skills` of an employee
  * `Languages_known`

> Stored in a **separate table** in databases due to multiple values.

### ✅ **5. Primary Key Attribute**

* **Shape:** Underlined Oval
* **Use When:** The attribute **uniquely identifies** an entity.
* **Example:**

  * `Student_ID`
  * `Account_Number`
  * `ISBN` for a book

### ✅ **6. Weak Key Attribute (Partial Key)**

* **Shape:** Dashed Oval or Dotted underlined oval
* **Use When:** Used with a **strong entity’s key** to identify a **weak entity**.
* **Example:**

  * `Payment_No` in a `Payment` entity
  * `Dependent_Name` in a `Dependent` entity
  * `Item_Number` in an `Order_Item` entity

> Alone it's not unique — needs a foreign key from the strong entity.

### ✅ **7. Derived Attribute**

* **Shape:** Dashed Oval (Dotted Border)
* **Use When:** The attribute is **calculated** from other data.
* **Example:**

  * `Age` (derived from Date\_of\_Birth)
  * `Total_Price` (derived from quantity × unit price)
  * `Tenure` (derived from joining date)

### ✅ **8. Relationship**

* **Shape:** Diamond
* **Use When:** You need to **connect two or more entities** to show how they are related.
* **Example:**

  * `Enrolls` between `Student` and `Course`
  * `Borrows` between `Customer` and `Book`
  * `Manages` between `Manager` and `Department`

### ✅ **9. Weak Relationship**

* **Shape:** Double Diamond
* **Use When:** The relationship **identifies a weak entity**.
* **Example:**

  * `Has` relationship between `Loan` and `Payment`
  * `Contains` between `Order` and `Order_Item`

### ✅ **10. Total Participation**

* **Shape:** Line connecting entity to relationship is **double**
* **Use When:** Every instance of the entity **must participate** in the relationship.
* **Example:**

  * Every `Payment` must be linked to a `Loan`
  * Every `Order_Item` must belong to an `Order`

Let me break down **Total Participation** in the **simplest possible way** with visuals and examples.

### 📌 What is **Total Participation**?

**Total Participation** means:

> **Every instance of an entity must be involved in a relationship.**
> There cannot be an entity without a related entry in another entity.

### 🔍 How to Identify it in ER Diagrams?

* Represented using a **double line** between the **entity** and the **relationship**.

### ✅ Simple Example: `Payment` and `Loan`

#### Scenario:

* A **Loan** can have **many Payments**.
* But **every Payment must belong to a Loan**.

#### ER View:

```
Loan ───────<makes>══════ Payment
                  ↑
              (Double Line)
```

> This double line shows:
> **Every Payment must be related to a Loan.**
> You can't have a payment without a loan.

### ✅ Another Example: `Order` and `Order_Item`

#### Scenario:

* One **Order** can have many **Order\_Items**.
* But **each Order\_Item must belong to some Order**.

#### ER View:

```
Order ───────<contains>══════ Order_Item
                       ↑
                 (Double Line)
```

* `Order`: strong entity
* `Order_Item`: weak entity
* `contains`: relationship
* **Double line** shows total participation:

> Every `Order_Item` must be linked to an `Order`.

### ❌ Opposite: **Partial Participation** (Single Line)

#### Example: `Student` and `Club`

* Some students join clubs, some don’t. So not all `Student` instances are in `Club`.

```
Student ─────── joins ─────── Club
     (Single Line)
```

This is **partial participation** — not all students must participate.

### 🔑 How to Remember?

| Type                      | Line   | Meaning                                   | Example                              |
| ------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Total Participation**   | Double | All entity instances **must** participate | Every Payment must be part of a Loan |
| **Partial Participation** | Single | Some entity instances **may** participate | Some Students may join a Club        |
