# -> First thing first that one entity means one row and one attribute means one column in the table remember that everytime
# -> If there is 1000 entities means 1000 rows and 1000 attributes means 1000 columns in the table remember that everytime


Let's go through the content of your image in **very detailed**, **simple**, and **easy-to-understand** language, with **examples** so you can grasp every point clearly.

## 🔷 2. ER Model

### ➤ What is an ER Model?
An **ER (Entity-Relationship) Model** is like a **map or diagram** that helps us design a database before we actually build it.

It shows:
- What kind of **data** we need to store
- What **objects** (called **entities**) are involved
- How those objects are **related** to each other

### ➤ Real-World Example:
Imagine you're building a **college database**. You need to store information like:
- Students
- Teachers
- Courses
- Which student is enrolled in which course

You use an **ER model** to draw this out first so everything is well-planned.

### ➤ ER Diagram
The **ER diagram** is the **visual representation** of the ER model. It acts like a **blueprint** (just like how a building has an architectural plan).

📌 It shows:
- **Entities**: things like Student, Course
- **Attributes**: Student Name, Student Roll No.
- **Relationships**: Student “enrolls in” Course

## 🔷 3. Entity

An **Entity** is just a **thing**, **object**, or **person** you want to store information about.

👉 **Example**:  
- A **Student** is an entity.  
- A **Book**, a **Car**, a **Teacher** — all are entities.

### ➤ Key Points about Entities:

#### 1. **It has physical existence**
This means it actually **exists in real life**.
- For example: A student sitting in a classroom is physically real.

#### 2. **Each student in a college is an entity**
If there are 1,000 students in a college, then we have **1,000 entities** of type “Student”.

#### 3. **Entity can be uniquely identified**
Each student must have something that **uniquely identifies** them.  
✅ Example: Roll number, Student ID  
🧠 This is called a **Primary Key**.

### ➤ Strong Entity

A **Strong Entity** is an entity that:
- **Can stand alone**
- Has a **unique key** (a primary key)

✅ Example:
- A **Student** with Roll No.
- An **Employee** with Employee ID

These can be **uniquely identified** by themselves.

### ➤ Weak Entity

A **Weak Entity** is an entity that:
- **Cannot be uniquely identified on its own**
- **Depends on another (strong) entity** to be identified

#### 🧠 Example:
Let’s take a **Loan and Payment** scenario.

- **Loan** is a strong entity (each loan has a unique ID).
- **Payment** is a weak entity, because:
  - Payment number like “1st payment” is **not unique** by itself.
  - You need to know **which loan** the payment belongs to.
  - Only then you can say: "1st payment of Loan #45".

So, the **Payment** depends on the **Loan** to be uniquely identified.

> 🔁 Think of Weak Entity as a baby—it can’t survive without its parent (the Strong Entity).

## 🔷 4. Entity Set

An **Entity Set** is a **group of similar entities** (like a category).

### ➤ Example:

- All students in a college form the **Student** entity set.
- All books in a library form the **Book** entity set.
- All customers in a bank form the **Customer** entity set.

📌 Each entity in a set:
- Has the **same kind of data** (same attributes)
- Belongs to the **same category**

### 🔁 Summary with Simple Examples:

| Concept | Real-Life Example | Explanation |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| Entity | Student | A real-world object we store data about |
| Strong Entity | Employee with EmployeeID | Can be identified on its own |
| Weak Entity | Payment for a Loan | Needs another entity to be identified |
| Entity Set | All students | A group of similar entities |
| ER Diagram | Student—Enrolls—Course | Visual plan of data and relationships |
