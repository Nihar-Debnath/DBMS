Great question! You're using **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**, and you just installed **MySQL Server** on it. Since it's a **server process**, you **won’t see a desktop icon** or something in your `~/` (home) directory like a normal app. But here's exactly **where things go and how you can interact with it** after installation:

---

## 🔍 Where is MySQL installed in WSL?

### 1. **Binaries (the actual commands you can run)**
The main commands like `mysql`, `mysqld`, etc., are installed to system-wide directories:

```bash
/usr/bin/mysql
/usr/sbin/mysqld
```

You can confirm this using:

```bash
which mysql
```

➡️ Output: `/usr/bin/mysql`

---

### 2. **Configuration files**
The main configuration file is usually located at:

```bash
/etc/mysql/my.cnf
```

This file tells MySQL how to start, what port to use, where to store data, etc.

---

### 3. **Data directory (actual database files)**
MySQL stores all your databases, tables, and data here:

```bash
/var/lib/mysql
```

> ⚠️ Be careful! Don’t directly edit or delete files from here unless you know exactly what you’re doing.

---

### 4. **Logs**
MySQL logs are typically stored at:

```bash
/var/log/mysql/
```

Inside you’ll find files like `error.log`, which is useful for debugging if MySQL fails to start or crashes.

## 📦 How to Interact With MySQL After Installation

Since WSL is a terminal-only environment, you interact with MySQL via **CLI tools**:

### 🔸 Open the MySQL client:
```bash
sudo mysql
```
This logs you in to the MySQL shell as root.

### 🔸 Create a new database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE test_db;
```

### 🔸 List all databases:
```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

### 🔸 Exit:
```sql
exit;
```

---

## ✅ Check if MySQL is running

```bash
sudo systemctl status mysql
```

Or if `systemctl` isn’t supported in your WSL version:

```bash
sudo service mysql status
```

If it’s not running:

```bash
sudo service mysql start
```

---

## 🚀 Tip: Enable MySQL auto-start on WSL launch (optional)

WSL doesn’t automatically start services like a normal Linux system. You can automate MySQL startup using a `.bashrc` or `.profile` trick:

Add this to the bottom of `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
sudo service mysql start > /dev/null
```

Then reload:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

> This will prompt for password each time you launch WSL unless you configure passwordless sudo (optional).

- Create a user and password in MySQL
- Secure MySQL installation
- Access MySQL from Windows GUI tools like **MySQL Workbench** using WSL setup
