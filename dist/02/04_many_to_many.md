### ‚úÖ **Many-to-Many (M:N) Relationship in DBMS**

---

### üí° **What is a Many-to-Many Relationship?**
- A **many-to-many (M:N)** relationship means that:  
    - **One record** in **Entity A** can be related to **many records** in **Entity B**.  
    - And **one record** in **Entity B** can also be related to **many records** in **Entity A**.  
- This relationship requires a **junction table** (also called a bridge or associative table) to break it into **two one-to-many relationships**.  

---

### üî• **Example: Students and Courses**
- In a **university database**:  
    - **One student** can enroll in **many courses**.  
    - **One course** can have **many students** enrolled.  
- **Entities:**  
    - `Student` ‚Üí Represents the students.  
    - `Course` ‚Üí Represents the courses.  
- **Relationship:**  
    - **Many Students ‚Üî Many Courses**.

- **Primary Keys (PK):**  
    - `Rollno` ‚Üí Primary key for the **Student** table.  
    - `CourseID` ‚Üí Primary key for the **Course** table.  
- **Junction Table:**  
    - `Enrollment` is the **junction table** that:  
        - Contains **two foreign keys**: `Rollno` (Student) and `CourseID` (Course).  
        - Establishes the **M:N relationship** by creating **two 1:M relationships**.

### ‚úÖ **Example Tables:**

**Student Table:**
| **Rollno (PK)**  | **StudentName**  |
|------------------|------------------|
| 101              | Rahul            |
| 102              | Priya            |
| 103              | Anjali           |
| 104              | Amit             |

**Course Table:**
| **CourseID (PK)**  | **CourseName**    |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| C101                | Database          |
| C102                | Web Development   |
| C103                | Java Programming  |

**Enrollment Table (Junction Table):**
| **Rollno (FK)**  | **CourseID (FK)**  |
|------------------|--------------------|
| 101              | C101               |
| 101              | C102               |
| 102              | C101               |
| 102              | C103               |
| 103              | C102               |
| 104              | C103               |

‚úÖ **Explanation:**
- **Rahul (101)** ‚Üí Enrolled in **C101 and C102**.  
- **Priya (102)** ‚Üí Enrolled in **C101 and C103**.  
- **Anjali (103)** ‚Üí Enrolled in **C102**.  
- **Amit (104)** ‚Üí Enrolled in **C103**.  
- **One student** can enroll in **many courses**, and **one course** can have **many students**.

### ‚úÖ **SQL Query Example:**
```sql
-- Create Student table
CREATE TABLE Student (
    Rollno INT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentName VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Create Course table
CREATE TABLE Course (
    CourseID VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
    CourseName VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Create Junction Table for M:N relationship
CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
    Rollno INT,
    CourseID VARCHAR(10),
    PRIMARY KEY (Rollno, CourseID),   -- Composite Primary Key
    FOREIGN KEY (Rollno) REFERENCES Student(Rollno),
    FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Course(CourseID)
);
```
‚úÖ **Explanation:**
1. The **Enrollment table** acts as a **junction table** with two **foreign keys**:  
    - `Rollno` ‚Üí References the **Student** table.  
    - `CourseID` ‚Üí References the **Course** table.  
2. The **composite primary key** (`Rollno, CourseID`) ensures **uniqueness** ‚Üí preventing duplicate enrollments.

### ‚úÖ **Key Characteristics of M:N Relationship:**
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Many-to-Many Mapping:**  
- **Multiple records** in the first table relate to **multiple records** in the second table.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Junction Table:**  
- The **M:N relationship** is converted into two **1:M relationships** using a **junction table**.  
- The junction table contains **two foreign keys** pointing to both tables.

---

### ‚úÖ **Real-World Examples of M:N Relationships:**
- **Students ‚Üî Courses:**  
    - Many students enroll in many courses.  
- **Customers ‚Üî Products:**  
    - Many customers buy many products.  
- **Authors ‚Üî Books:**  
    - Many authors write many books.  
- **Doctors ‚Üî Patients:**  
    - Many doctors treat many patients.

### üöÄ **Key Takeaway:**  
- In a **many-to-many (M:N) relationship**, both entities are related to **multiple records** of each other.  
- To represent this in **relational databases**, you need a **junction table** that connects the two entities with **two foreign keys**. ‚úÖ
