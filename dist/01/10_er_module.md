### ✅ **ER Model (Entity-Relationship Model) for Students and Courses**

---

### 💡 **What is an ER Model?**
An **ER Model** is a **graphical representation** of real-world entities and the relationships between them.  
- **Entities** → Real-world objects (e.g., Student, Course).  
- **Attributes** → Properties of the entity (e.g., Rollno, Name, Course ID).  
- **Relationships** → Associations between the entities (e.g., A student **enrolls** in a course).

### 🔥 **ER Model for Students and Courses**

#### **Entities:**
1️⃣ **Student**
- Represents the students in the system.  
- **Attributes:**  
    - `Rollno` → Unique ID for each student (**Primary Key**).  
    - `Name` → Student’s name.  
    - `Age` → Age of the student.  
    - `Email` → Contact info.  

2️⃣ **Course**
- Represents the courses offered.  
- **Attributes:**  
    - `CourseID` → Unique ID for each course (**Primary Key**).  
    - `CourseName` → Name of the course.  
    - `Credits` → Number of credits.  
    - `Duration` → Duration of the course.

---

#### **Relationship:**
- **Enrolls**
    - A **many-to-many relationship** → A student can enroll in **multiple courses**, and a course can have **many students**.  
    - This creates a **bridge table** with:  
        - `Rollno` → Refers to the `Student` entity.  
        - `CourseID` → Refers to the `Course` entity.  
        - `EnrollmentDate` → The date when the student enrolled.

### ✅ **Explanation:**
1️⃣ **Entities:**  
- The `Student` table has a **Primary Key** → `Rollno`.  
- The `Course` table has a **Primary Key** → `CourseID`.  

2️⃣ **Many-to-Many Relationship:**  
- The **Enrolls** table acts as a **bridge table** to represent the many-to-many relationship.  
- It contains:  
    - `Rollno` → **Foreign Key** referencing the `Student` table.  
    - `CourseID` → **Foreign Key** referencing the `Course` table.  
    - `EnrollmentDate` → Additional attribute showing when the student enrolled in the course.

### ✅ **Example Data:**

| **Student Table**       |                   | **Course Table**        |
|--------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Rollno    | Name     | Age   | Email            | CourseID   | CourseName    | Credits  |
| 101       | Rahul    | 21    | rahul@gmail.com  | C101       | DBMS          | 4        |
| 102       | Priya    | 22    | priya@gmail.com  | C102       | OOP           | 3        |
| 103       | Anjali   | 20    | anjali@gmail.com | C103       | Web Dev       | 5        |

| **Enrolls Table**         |
|----------------------------|
| Rollno    | CourseID   | EnrollmentDate |
| 101       | C101       | 2025-03-31     |
| 101       | C103       | 2025-04-01     |
| 102       | C101       | 2025-03-30     |
| 103       | C102       | 2025-03-31     |

### ✅ **Key Takeaway:**
- **Entities:** `Student` and `Course`.  
- **Attributes:** Describe the properties of each entity.  
- **Relationship:**  
    - **Many-to-Many** → A student can enroll in multiple courses, and a course can have many students.  
    - Represented by the **Enrolls** table, which contains **Foreign Keys** referencing both entities.  
- This **ER Model** ensures **data integrity**, prevents **redundancy**, and makes querying data more efficient. 🚀
