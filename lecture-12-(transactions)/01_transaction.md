### 💡 What is a Transaction?

A **Transaction** is like a small **task or job** done in a database. It is a group of **steps that must all happen together**.

### 🎯 Real-Life Example:

Let’s say you go to the bank and transfer ₹1000 from your **Account A** to **Account B**. This simple action has **two steps**:

1. ₹1000 is taken out of **Account A**.
2. ₹1000 is added to **Account B**.

These two steps together form **one transaction**.

> If step 1 happens but step 2 fails, then the money is lost!
> So, either **both steps should happen**, or **none at all**.

This is the core idea of a **transaction** in a database.

### 🧠 Why is a Transaction Important?

A transaction helps the database make sure that:

* **Data is correct** and **safe**.
* If anything goes wrong (like a power cut or error), the database can **undo** the changes.
* Only **complete and successful** transactions are saved.

### 📘 Formal Simple Definition:

A **Transaction** is a group of one or more steps (like SQL commands) that are done **together** as a single unit.
If **all steps succeed**, the changes are saved.
If **any step fails**, all changes are **cancelled**.

### 🔁 Example with SQL Steps:

Imagine this transaction:

```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE AccountA SET balance = balance - 1000;
UPDATE AccountB SET balance = balance + 1000;
COMMIT;
```

* `BEGIN;` → Starts the transaction
* Two update steps → Move money from A to B
* `COMMIT;` → If everything goes well, changes are saved.

If anything goes wrong before `COMMIT`, we can use:

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

To cancel all the steps and go back to the way things were.

### 📦 Properties of a Good Transaction: **ACID**

ACID is what makes transactions safe and reliable:

1. **Atomicity**: All or nothing – either all steps happen or none.
2. **Consistency**: Data should follow the rules (no corruption).
3. **Isolation**: One transaction should not mess with another.
4. **Durability**: Once a transaction is done, changes stay saved, even after a crash.

| Why use it?          | To keep data safe, correct, and reliable     |
| What if it fails?    | All changes are undone (rollback)            |
| What if it succeeds? | All changes are saved (commit)               |
