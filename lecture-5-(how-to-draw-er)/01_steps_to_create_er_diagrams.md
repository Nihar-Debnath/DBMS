## ✅ Steps to Create an ER Diagram

### **Step 1: Identify Entities**
- Entities are objects or concepts that store data.
- Examples: `Customer`, `Account`, `Branch`, `Transaction`

### **Step 2: Identify Relationships**
- Define how entities are connected.
- Example: A `Customer` **opens** an `Account`, an `Account` **belongs to** a `Branch`.

### **Step 3: Identify Attributes**
- Each entity will have attributes (columns).
- Mark primary keys (`PK`) and foreign keys (`FK`).
- Example: `CustomerID`, `Name`, `Balance`

### **Step 4: Identify Cardinality**
- Define how many instances of an entity relate to others.
- One-to-One (1:1), One-to-Many (1:N), Many-to-Many (M:N)

### **Step 5: Determine Participation Constraints**
- Total Participation: all entities must participate (shown with a double line).
- Partial Participation: optional (single line).

### **Step 6: Add Specialization/Generalization (if needed)**
- For example, if `Account` can be `SavingsAccount` or `CurrentAccount`, use specialization.

### **Step 7: Add Aggregation (if needed)**
- When a relationship itself participates in another relationship.

In a requirements engineering interview, being asked to create an **ER (Entity-Relationship) model and diagram** for a **banking system** is common. Here’s how you can approach it step by step:

## ✅ Step 1: Understand the Basic Requirements of a Banking System

A typical banking system might include features like:

* Customer management
* Account management (Savings, Current, etc.)
* Transactions (Deposit, Withdraw, Transfer)
* Loans
* Employees/Branch management

## ✅ Step 2: Identify the Main Entities

Common entities in a banking system ER model:

1. **Customer**
2. **Account**
3. **Transaction**
4. **Branch**
5. **Loan**
6. **Employee**

## ✅ Step 3: Define Attributes for Each Entity

**Customer**

* Customer_ID (Primary Key)
* Name
* Address
* Phone
* Email

**Account**

* Account_Number (Primary Key)
* Account_Type
* Balance
* Customer_ID (Foreign Key)
* Branch_ID (Foreign Key)

**Transaction**

* Transaction_ID (Primary Key)
* Date
* Amount
* Type (Deposit, Withdraw, Transfer)
* Account_Number (Foreign Key)

**Branch**

* Branch_ID (Primary Key)
* Branch_Name
* Location

**Loan**

* Loan_ID (Primary Key)
* Loan_Type
* Amount
* Customer_ID (Foreign Key)
* Branch_ID (Foreign Key)

**Employee**

* Employee_ID (Primary Key)
* Name
* Designation
* Branch_ID (Foreign Key)

## ✅ Step 4: Define Relationships

* A **Customer** can have **multiple Accounts**, but each Account belongs to **one Customer**. → **1:M**
* An **Account** can have **many Transactions**. → **1:M**
* A **Customer** can take **multiple Loans**. → **1:M**
* A **Branch** can have **multiple Customers, Accounts, Loans, and Employees**. → **1:M**
* An **Employee** works at **one Branch**, and a **Branch** can have many Employees. → **1:M**

## ✅ Step 5: Create the ER Diagram

You can use tools like:

* **Draw.io** (Free, easy)
* **Lucidchart**
* **dbdiagram.io**
* **MySQL Workbench** (for database + ERD)
* **Microsoft Visio** (if available)

Er model of banking system:
1. banking system - branches (name)
2. bank - cuntomers
3. customers - accounts, take loan
4. customer associted with some banker
5. bank has employees
6. accounts - saving and current account
7. loan originated by branch - payment schedulers
8. loan >= 1 customer

Now, let's organize all this and **prepare it as a clean, presentable ER diagram** based on this structure.

## ✅ Clean Breakdown of Your ER Model

### **Entity Sets**

| Entity                      | Attributes                                                                                                |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Branch**                  | name (PK), city, asset, liabilities                                                                       |
| **Customer**                | cust\_id (PK), name, address (composite), contact\_no (multivalued), dob, age (derived)                   |
| **Employee**                | emp\_id (PK), name, contact\_no, dependent\_name (multivalued), start\_date, years\_of\_service (derived) |
| **Account** *(generalized)* | account\_no (PK), balance                                                                                 |
| **Saving\_Account**         | account\_no (PK), interest\_rate, daily\_withdrawal\_limit (inherits from `Account`)                      |
| **Current\_Account**        | account\_no (PK), per\_transaction\_charges, overdraft\_amount (inherits from `Account`)                  |
| **Loan**                    | loan\_number (PK), amount                                                                                 |
| **Payment** *(weak entity)* | payment\_no (partial key), date, amount                                                                   |

### **Relationships and Cardinalities**

| Relationship         | Entities Involved            | Cardinality | Notes                             |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| **borrows**          | Customer — Loan              | M\:N        | Many customers can share a loan   |
| **originated\_by**   | Loan — Branch                | M:1         | Loan is created at a branch       |
| **loan\_payment**    | Loan — Payment (weak)        | 1\:N        | One loan can have many payments   |
| **deposits**         | Customer — Account           | M\:N        | A customer can have many accounts |
| **associated\_with** | Customer — Employee (Banker) | N:1         | Each customer has one banker      |
| **manages**          | Employee — Employee          | M:1         | Employee is managed by another    |

### **Generalization**

* `Saving_Account` and `Current_Account` are subclasses of `Account`.

### **Weak Entity**

* `Payment` is a weak entity dependent on `Loan`.
