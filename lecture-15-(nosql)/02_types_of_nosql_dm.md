### **NoSQL Data Models Explained in Simple Words**

NoSQL databases are like different ways to store information other than the traditional tables (rows and columns) you see in normal databases. Two common NoSQL types are:

### **1. Key-Value Store:**

* **Think of it like a Dictionary:** You have a key (a word) and a value (the meaning of that word).

  * For example, in a dictionary:

    * Key: "State" → Value: "Alaska"
    * Key: "Username" → Value: "John123"

* **When to Use:**

  * For fast lookups. Like finding someone’s profile quickly using their username.
  * For remembering settings, like your game preferences.

* **Examples:**

  * Amazon DynamoDB, Redis, MongoDB (it can also do other things).

### **2. Column-Oriented Store:**

* **Think of it like a Spreadsheet but Focused on Columns:**

  * Instead of storing data row by row, it stores it column by column.
  * This is great when you need to quickly find data in one specific column, like a list of all prices in a product list.

* **When to Use:**

  * For data analysis, where you only care about certain columns (like total sales).
  * For fast reading of specific data, like getting all customer ages quickly.

* **Examples:**

  * Cassandra, HBase, ScyllaDB.

### **6. Types of NoSQL Data Models**

#### **1. Key-Value Stores:**

1. **The simplest type of NoSQL database is a key-value store.**

   * Imagine a key-value store like a giant dictionary or phone book.
   * You have a **"key" (like a name)** and a **"value" (like a phone number)**.

2. **A key-value store is like a relational database with only two columns:**

   * One column is for the **"key" (like "state")**.
   * The other column is for the **"value" (like "Alaska")**.

3. **Use cases include shopping carts, user preferences, and user profiles.**

   * This means key-value stores are great for apps where you need to:

     * Remember what items a user has in their cart (shopping carts).
     * Remember user settings (user preferences).
     * Store simple user data (user profiles).

4. **Examples of key-value store databases:**

   * **Oracle NoSQL:** A key-value database by Oracle.
   * **Amazon DynamoDB:** A fast, cloud-based key-value store by Amazon.
   * **MongoDB:** Mainly a document database but also supports key-value storage.
   * **Redis:** An extremely fast, in-memory key-value database.

5. **A key-value database associates a value with a key.**

   * This means every value (like "Alaska") has a unique key (like "state").
   * The value can be anything: a number, a text, an image, or even a list.

6. **Key-value stores are like a dictionary or array/map in programming.**

   * In programming, a dictionary looks like this:

     ```python
     user_preferences = {"theme": "dark", "font_size": 14}
     ```
   * Key-value stores work in a similar way but save data permanently.

7. **Key-value databases use efficient index structures for fast data lookup.**

   * Indexing is like a bookmark in a book.
   * It helps the database quickly find the right value for a given key.

8. **Use cases for key-value stores:**

   * **a) Real-time random data access:**

     * Example: Quickly finding your game settings when you log in.
   * **b) Caching:**

     * Example: Storing frequently used data to make apps faster.
   * **c) Simple key-based queries:**

     * Example: Finding a user's profile using their username.

### **2. Column-Oriented (Columnar) Stores:**

1. **The data is stored so that each row of a column is next to other rows from that column.**

   * Imagine a spreadsheet.
   * In a column store, all values in one column (like "Price") are saved together.

2. **Unlike relational databases (row-based), column stores are organized by columns.**

   * A normal database stores data row by row, like:

     ```
     Name | Age | Country
     John | 25  | USA
     Mary | 30  | UK
     ```
   * But a column store keeps it like this:

     * Names: John, Mary
     * Ages: 25, 30
     * Countries: USA, UK

3. **Column stores are great for analytics because you can quickly access specific columns.**

   * If you want to calculate the average age, it directly reads the "Age" column.
   * This makes it faster for large datasets.

4. **Column stores can compress data better.**

   * If a column has repeating values (like "USA, USA, USA..."), it can save space.
   * This also makes it faster because less data needs to be read.

5. **Examples of column-oriented databases:**

   * **Cassandra:** A highly scalable column store by Apache.
   * **Redshift:** A cloud-based column store by Amazon.
   * **Snowflake:** A popular cloud-based column store for data analytics.

### **6. Types of NoSQL Data Models (Continued)**

### **3. Document-Based Stores:**

1. **This DB (Database) stores data in documents similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects.**

   * Think of each document like a digital form you fill out.
   * Each form has fields (like name, age, email) and values (like John, 25, [john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com)).
   * These fields can hold any type of data, like text, numbers, lists, or even another form.

2. **Use cases include:**

   * **E-commerce platforms:** Storing product details, user orders, etc.
   * **Trading platforms:** Storing user portfolios, trade histories.
   * **Mobile app development:** Storing user profiles, app settings.

3. **Supports ACID properties, making it suitable for transactions.**

   * ACID means:

     * **A**tomicity: Every action in a transaction completes fully or not at all.
     * **C**onsistency: The database always stays in a valid state.
     * **I**solation: Transactions do not affect each other.
     * **D**urability: Once data is saved, it stays saved even after power loss.

4. **Examples:**

   * **MongoDB:** The most popular document-based database.
   * **CouchDB:** Another document-based database by Apache.

### **4. Graph-Based Stores:**

1. **This database focuses on the relationship between data elements.**

   * Imagine a social network like Facebook.
   * Each person is a **"node"** (like a user profile).
   * Each connection between people (like a "friend request") is a **"link" or "relationship."**

2. **Optimized for capturing and searching these relationships.**

   * It can find connections between friends of friends quickly.
   * In a normal database, finding this would be slow because you would need to "JOIN" many tables.

3. **Real-world use is usually combined with other database types.**

   * This is because only a few apps are purely about relationships.
   * For example, a social media app uses graph databases for friend connections but stores user posts in another database.

4. **Use cases include:**

   * **Fraud detection:** Finding unusual links between accounts or transactions.
   * **Social networks:** Storing users and their connections.
   * **Knowledge graphs:** Storing information and how it connects (like Wikipedia).

### **NoSQL Databases Disadvantages:**

#### **1. Data Redundancy:**

1. **NoSQL databases are optimized for fast data access, not for reducing duplicates.**

   * This means the same data can be stored in multiple places.
   * Example: If user details are stored in many places, updating one place doesn’t update all.

2. **Update and delete operations can be costly.**

   * Because data might be duplicated in many places, changing it means updating every copy.
   * This can be slow for large databases.

3. **NoSQL may not fit all your needs.**

   * Each type of NoSQL database is good for certain jobs:

     * **Key-Value:** Fast lookups by key.
     * **Document:** Storing complex data like user profiles.
     * **Columnar:** Fast analytics.
     * **Graph:** Relationships between data.

4. **Doesn't support ACID properties in general (except Document Stores like MongoDB).**

   * Most NoSQL databases trade off strict data safety for speed.
   * For example, a key-value store might lose data if your app crashes suddenly.

5. **Doesn't support data consistency very well.**

   * If the same data is saved in many places, it can become outdated in some places.
   * For example, if you change your profile picture, it might still show the old one somewhere.

### **SQL vs NoSQL - Detailed Explanation**

### **1. Data Storage Model**

#### **SQL Databases:**

* **Data is stored in Tables:**

  * Each table has **fixed rows and columns.**
  * Each column has a specific data type (like text, number, date).
  * Each row is a record of data, and each column represents an attribute of that record.

✅ **Example:**

* A table called `Students` might look like this:

| StudentID | Name       | Age | Grade |
| --------- | ---------- | --- | ----- |
| 1         | John Doe   | 20  | A     |
| 2         | Jane Smith | 22  | B     |

* The table has a **fixed structure.**
* If you want to add a new column (like "Email"), you must update the table's design.

#### **NoSQL Databases:**

* **Data is stored in flexible ways depending on the type of NoSQL database:**

  * **Document-Based:** Data is stored as JSON or BSON documents.

    ```json
    {
      "StudentID": 1,
      "Name": "John Doe",
      "Age": 20,
      "Grade": "A"
    }
    ```
  * **Key-Value:** Like a dictionary or a phone book, with a key and a value.

    ```json
    "StudentID_1": {"Name": "John Doe", "Age": 20, "Grade": "A"}
    ```
  * **Column-Oriented:** Each column is stored separately, like in a spreadsheet.

    ```plaintext
    Column: StudentID → 1, 2  
    Column: Name → John Doe, Jane Smith  
    ```
  * **Graph-Based:** Data is stored as nodes and relationships.

    * Node: John (student), Course (subject).
    * Relationship: John is enrolled in Course.

✅ **Example NoSQL Databases:**

* Document: MongoDB, CouchDB
* Key-Value: Redis, DynamoDB
* Columnar: Cassandra, HBase
* Graph: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune

### **2. Development History**

#### **SQL Databases:**

* **Started in the 1970s.**
* Main focus was on **reducing data duplication** and maintaining data accuracy.
* Built for business applications where data must be consistent and reliable.

✅ **Example:**

* Oracle (1977), MySQL (1995), Microsoft SQL Server (1989), PostgreSQL (1996).

#### **NoSQL Databases:**

* **Started in the 2000s.**
* Focused on **scaling easily** and adapting to changes quickly.
* Built for modern apps that need to handle large amounts of data and change quickly.

✅ **Example:**

* MongoDB (2009), CouchDB (2005), Cassandra (2008), Neo4j (2007).

### **3. Examples of Each Type**

| SQL Databases                                   | NoSQL Databases                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL | MongoDB, CouchDB (Document), Redis, DynamoDB (Key-Value), Cassandra, HBase (Columnar), Neo4j, Amazon Neptune (Graph) |

### **4. Primary Purpose**

#### **SQL Databases:**

* **General-purpose databases:**

  * Can be used for almost any type of application.
  * Best for applications where data relationships are important.

✅ **Example Use Cases:**

* Banking systems (transactions must be accurate).
* Employee management systems (clear relationships between employees and departments).

#### **NoSQL Databases:**

* **Specialized for specific use cases:**

  * Document: Storing complex data (e.g., product details, user profiles).
  * Key-Value: Fast lookups (e.g., caching, user sessions).
  * Columnar: Fast analytics (e.g., sales analysis).
  * Graph: Finding relationships (e.g., social networks, fraud detection).

✅ **Example Use Cases:**

* Document: E-commerce product catalog (MongoDB).
* Key-Value: User session management (Redis).
* Columnar: Analyzing website traffic (Cassandra).
* Graph: Social network (Neo4j).

### **5. Schemas (Data Structure)**

#### **SQL Databases:**

* **Fixed Schema:**

  * The table structure (columns) must be defined before storing data.
  * If you want to add new data types, you must modify the table structure.

✅ **Example:**

* If you add an "Email" column to the `Students` table, it must be done by changing the table design.

#### **NoSQL Databases:**

* **Flexible Schema:**

  * No need to define the structure before storing data.
  * Each document can have its own unique fields.

✅ **Example:**

* One student document may have an "Email" field, and another may not.

```json
{
  "StudentID": 1,
  "Name": "John Doe",
  "Email": "john@example.com"
}
```

```json
{
  "StudentID": 2,
  "Name": "Jane Smith"
}
```

### **6. Scaling**

#### **SQL Databases:**

* **Vertical Scaling (Scale-Up):**

  * Increase the power of a single server (more RAM, better CPU).
  * Limited because one server can only be so powerful.

✅ **Example:**

* Upgrading a server from 8 GB RAM to 64 GB RAM.

#### **NoSQL Databases:**

* **Horizontal Scaling (Scale-Out):**

  * Add more servers to handle more data.
  * More flexible because you can add servers as needed.

✅ **Example:**

* Adding more servers to a MongoDB cluster as your app grows.

### **7. ACID Properties**

#### **SQL Databases:**

* **Fully Support ACID Properties:**

  * Data is always consistent, safe, and reliable.
  * Perfect for financial systems where even the smallest error is unacceptable.

✅ **Example:**

* A bank transaction (transferring money) must complete fully, or it should not happen at all.

#### **NoSQL Databases:**

* **Generally, do not support full ACID:**

  * Prioritize speed and flexibility over strict data safety.
  * But some NoSQL databases (like MongoDB) can offer ACID for specific use cases.

✅ **Example:**

* Redis (a key-value store) is very fast but may lose data if the server crashes.

### **8. JOINS (Combining Tables)**

#### **SQL Databases:**

* **Joins are Common:**

  * Used to connect tables together using common keys.

✅ **Example:**

* Joining a `Students` table with a `Courses` table to find which students are taking which courses.

```sql
SELECT Students.Name, Courses.CourseName 
FROM Students 
JOIN Courses ON Students.StudentID = Courses.StudentID;
```

#### **NoSQL Databases:**

* **Joins are Not Required (or even impossible):**

  * Data is stored in a way that does not require joining.
  * For example, all user data can be in one document in MongoDB.


### **9. Data to Object Mapping**

#### **SQL Databases:**

* **Require Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):**

  * Converting database rows/columns to objects in code.
  * Popular ORMs: Sequelize (Node.js), Hibernate (Java), Django ORM (Python).

✅ **Example:**

* A `Student` class in code must match the columns of the `Students` table.

#### **NoSQL Databases:**

* **Do not need strict mapping:**

  * Data is stored in a format (like JSON) that directly matches code objects.
  * This makes it easy to read and write data in apps.

✅ **Example:**

* A JSON document in MongoDB can be directly converted to an object in JavaScript.
