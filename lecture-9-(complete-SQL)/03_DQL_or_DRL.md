## 📌 1. Basic Syntax of SELECT

```
SELECT <column names> FROM <table name>;
```

It means:
👉 "Hey database, give me these columns from this table!"

---

### 🧠 Example:

**Table: students**

| id | name    | age | grade |
| -- | ------- | --- | ----- |
| 1  | Alice   | 20  | A     |
| 2  | Bob     | 21  | B     |
| 3  | Charlie | 22  | A     |

Query:

```sql
SELECT name, age FROM students;
```

🔍 Output:

| name    | age |
| ------- | --- |
| Alice   | 20  |
| Bob     | 21  |
| Charlie | 22  |

You selected just the `name` and `age` columns from the `students` table.

---

## 📌 2. Order of Execution

SQL processes queries from **RIGHT to LEFT** in terms of clause execution.

For example:

```sql
SELECT name FROM students WHERE age > 20;
```

👉 Internally, SQL first processes the `FROM`, then `WHERE`, then `SELECT`.

---

## 📌 3. SELECT without a table?

Yes! You can use `SELECT` without an actual table using **DUAL**, a dummy table in some databases like Oracle or MySQL.

Examples:

```sql
SELECT 5 + 5;         -- Output: 10
SELECT NOW();         -- Gives current date & time
SELECT UCASE('abc');  -- Output: 'ABC'
```

These don’t need a table. MySQL handles these via a dummy table.

---

## 📌 4. WHERE clause (Apply conditions)

Used to filter rows.

```sql
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 20;
```

🔍 Output:

| id | name    | age | grade |
| -- | ------- | --- | ----- |
| 2  | Bob     | 21  | B     |
| 3  | Charlie | 22  | A     |

---

## 📌 5. BETWEEN (Range check)

```sql
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age BETWEEN 20 AND 21;
```

✔️ Includes both 20 and 21.

🔍 Output:

| id | name  | age | grade |
| -- | ----- | --- | ----- |
| 1  | Alice | 20  | A     |
| 2  | Bob   | 21  | B     |

---

## 📌 6. IN (Match one of many options)

```sql
SELECT * FROM students WHERE name IN ('Alice', 'Charlie');
```

🔍 Output:

| id | name    | age | grade |
| -- | ------- | --- | ----- |
| 1  | Alice   | 20  | A     |
| 3  | Charlie | 22  | A     |

Think of it like: “Is the value one of these?”

---

## 📌 7. AND / OR / NOT (Combine conditions)

* **AND**: All conditions must be true
* **OR**: Any one condition is true
* **NOT**: The opposite of the condition

```sql
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 20 AND grade = 'A';
```

Both conditions must be true.

```sql
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 20 OR grade = 'B';
```

Any condition being true is enough.

```sql
SELECT * FROM students WHERE NOT grade = 'A';
```

Return students **not** having grade A.

---

## 📌 8. NULL (Missing value)

Suppose a table:

**Table: tasks**

| id | task\_name | status |
| -- | ---------- | ------ |
| 1  | Homework   | done   |
| 2  | Assignment | NULL   |
| 3  | Project    | done   |

Query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE status IS NULL;
```

🔍 Output:

| id | task\_name | status |
| -- | ---------- | ------ |
| 2  | Assignment | NULL   |

👉 `NULL` is not a value — it means unknown or missing. Use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL`.

---

## 📌 9. Pattern Matching (LIKE & Wildcards)

Use `%` and `_` to search text patterns.

* `%`: any number of characters (like `*` in wildcards)
* `_`: exactly one character

```sql
SELECT * FROM students WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
```

Matches names starting with A.

🔍 Output:

| id | name  | age | grade |
| -- | ----- | --- | ----- |
| 1  | Alice | 20  | A     |

Another:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students WHERE name LIKE '%e';
```

Matches names ending with 'e':

* Alice
* Charlie

### 🔹 Wildcards Recap:

* `%` — Matches **zero or more** characters
* `_` — Matches **exactly one** character

### 📘 Sample Table: `Users`

| id | username  | email                                               |
| -- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | john123   | [john@gmail.com](mailto:john@gmail.com)             |
| 2  | jenny\_42 | [jenny\_42@yahoo.com](mailto:jenny_42@yahoo.com)    |
| 3  | jonathan  | [jonathan@outlook.com](mailto:jonathan@outlook.com) |
| 4  | jackie1   | [jackie1@gmail.com](mailto:jackie1@gmail.com)       |
| 5  | j\_hnny   | [fakejohn@yahoo.com](mailto:fakejohn@yahoo.com)     |
| 6  | j0hnny    | [j0hnny@gmail.com](mailto:j0hnny@gmail.com)         |
| 7  | jeff99    | [jeff@hotmail.com](mailto:jeff@hotmail.com)         |
| 8  | jonny     | [jonny@gmail.com](mailto:jonny@gmail.com)           |

### 🔍 Pattern Matching Examples:

#### ✅ i. Match usernames starting with "jo"

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username LIKE 'jo%';
```

**Explanation:** Starts with `jo`, followed by anything.

**Matches:**

* john123
* jonathan
* jonny

#### ✅ ii. Match usernames ending with "ny"

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username LIKE '%ny';
```

**Matches:**

* jonny

#### ✅ iii. Match usernames that have exactly 6 characters

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username LIKE '______';
```

(6 underscores)

**Matches:**

* j\_hnny
* j0hnny
* jeff99
* jonny (only if counted as 6 characters)

#### ✅ iv. Match usernames where the 2nd character is "o"

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username LIKE '_o%';
```

**Matches:**

* john123
* jonathan

#### ✅ v. Match usernames that start with "j", then any one character, then "hn"

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username LIKE 'j_hn%';
```

**Matches:**

* j\_hnny

#### ✅ vi. Match Gmail users

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email LIKE '%@gmail.com';
```

**Matches:**

* john123
* jackie1
* j0hnny
* jonny

#### ✅ vii. Match usernames with "nny" at the end, but **only one character before it**

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username LIKE '_nny';
```

**No match**, but:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username LIKE '__nny';
```

**Matches:**

* jonny (5 characters — "j" "o" "n" "n" "y")

### 🔍 Extra Tip: Escape characters

To search for a **literal underscore (`_`)** or percent sign (`%`), use **ESCAPE**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username LIKE 'j\_hn%' ESCAPE '\';
```

**Matches:**

* j\_hnny

## 📌 10. ORDER BY (Sort your results)

```sql
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY age DESC;
```

🔽 Output (Descending):

| id | name    | age | grade |
| -- | ------- | --- | ----- |
| 3  | Charlie | 22  | A     |
| 2  | Bob     | 21  | B     |
| 1  | Alice   | 20  | A     |

```sql
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY name ASC;
```

🔼 Output (Ascending name):

| id | name    | age | grade |
| -- | ------- | --- | ----- |
| 1  | Alice   | 20  | A     |
| 2  | Bob     | 21  | B     |
| 3  | Charlie | 22  | A     |

---

## 🧩 11. GROUP BY — Categorizing Data

### 🔸 What is `GROUP BY`?

The `GROUP BY` clause is used to **group rows** that have the **same values** in specific columns.
It’s **used with aggregation functions** like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()` to perform calculations on each group.

---

### 🧠 Example 1 — Let's say we have a table:

**Table: orders**

| order\_id | customer | product | quantity |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | -------- |
| 1         | Alice    | Apple   | 2        |
| 2         | Bob      | Apple   | 1        |
| 3         | Alice    | Banana  | 3        |
| 4         | Bob      | Banana  | 1        |
| 5         | Charlie  | Apple   | 2        |

---

### ✅ Goal: Total quantity ordered by each customer

```sql
SELECT customer, SUM(quantity)
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer;
```

🔍 Output:

| customer | SUM(quantity) |
| -------- | ------------- |
| Alice    | 5             |
| Bob      | 2             |
| Charlie  | 2             |

**Explanation**:

* All rows are grouped **by `customer`**.
* Then `SUM(quantity)` is applied to each group.

---

### ✅ Goal: Count how many orders each product has

```sql
SELECT product, COUNT(*) 
FROM orders 
GROUP BY product;
```

🔍 Output:

| product | COUNT(\*) |
| ------- | --------- |
| Apple   | 3         |
| Banana  | 2         |

---

### 🛠 Important Notes:

* Every column in the `SELECT` **that’s not an aggregation function** must be in the `GROUP BY`.
* You can group by one or more columns: `GROUP BY product, customer`.

---

## 📦 12. DISTINCT — Unique Values

### 🔸 What is `DISTINCT`?

The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to return **only unique (different)** values in a column.

---

### 🧠 Example 2 — Using orders table again:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT customer FROM orders;
```

🔍 Output:

| customer |
| -------- |
| Alice    |
| Bob      |
| Charlie  |

---

### 🔍 Compare: GROUP BY vs DISTINCT

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT customer FROM orders;

-- and

SELECT customer FROM orders GROUP BY customer;
```

📌 Both give the same output.

✅ SQL is smart!
If you use `GROUP BY` **without** any aggregation function — it behaves **like `DISTINCT`**.

---

## 🧮 13. GROUP BY with HAVING — Filter Grouped Results

### 🔸 What is `HAVING`?

* `HAVING` is used **after** `GROUP BY` to filter grouped results.
* Think of it like `WHERE`, but for grouped data.

---

### 🧠 Example 3 — Count customers per product and only show if more than 1

```sql
SELECT product, COUNT(customer) 
FROM orders 
GROUP BY product 
HAVING COUNT(customer) > 1;
```

🔍 Output:

| product | COUNT(customer) |
| ------- | --------------- |
| Apple   | 3               |
| Banana  | 2               |

---

### 📚 WHERE vs HAVING

| Feature        | WHERE                        | HAVING                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Used for       | Filtering **rows**           | Filtering **groups**          |
| Used with      | Before GROUP BY              | After GROUP BY                |
| Can use aggr.? | ❌ No (can’t use COUNT, etc.) | ✅ Yes (uses COUNT, SUM, etc.) |
| Example        | `WHERE quantity > 2`         | `HAVING SUM(quantity) > 5`    |

---

### 🧠 Example 4 — Invalid use of WHERE

```sql
-- ❌ This will throw an error:
SELECT customer, COUNT(*)
FROM orders
WHERE COUNT(*) > 1
GROUP BY customer;
```

✅ Correct version:

```sql
SELECT customer, COUNT(*)
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

🔍 Output:

| customer | COUNT(\*) |
| -------- | --------- |
| Alice    | 2         |
| Bob      | 2         |

---

### 🧠 Example 5 — WHERE and HAVING together

```sql
SELECT customer, SUM(quantity)
FROM orders
WHERE quantity >= 1 -- Filter individual rows first
GROUP BY customer
HAVING SUM(quantity) > 2; -- Then filter grouped result
```

🔍 Output:

| customer | SUM(quantity) |
| -------- | ------------- |
| Alice    | 5             |
