### âœ… **Why it is Aggregation:**

In the image:

- The **relationship `works_on`** connects three entities: `emp` (Employee), `Job`, and `branch`.
- That entire combination is **boxed** â€” this indicates that it's being treated as a **single unit** (i.e., aggregation).
- Then, there's a **separate relationship** called `manages` that connects another entity `managers` to this **entire boxed structure**.

ðŸ“Œ This is **classic aggregation**:  
> A relationship (`manages`) connects to another relationship (`works_on` between empâ€“jobâ€“branch), treated as a unit.


### ðŸ“˜ **Explanation (Line by Line)**

1. `emp`, `Job`, and `branch` are **entities**.
2. `works_on` is a **relationship** among those three entities.
3. This relationship is **grouped in a box** â†’ showing it's a single concept.
4. The **entity `managers`** is then linked to this **whole grouped structure** through another relationship (`manages`).

### ðŸ§  Real-World Analogy

Imagine:

- An employee **works on** a job in a specific branch â†’ that is one relationship.
- A manager doesn't just manage an employee or job individually â€” they manage the **assignment** itself: the **whole setup**.
  
That's aggregation: treating a **relationship** like an **object** so you can associate more meaning with it.
